 Knowledge Boost Courses - API (under construction)

## About the project

An Node.js REST API for a courses platform that I'm developing from scratch for study purposes.

The idea is to apply the best practices, such as good architecture, new concepts, and new technologies, and also stay up-to-date with the latest trends.

My main focus with this project is the backend for the moment, but I have plans to start the frontend using React in another repository.
